## About *Me*

Hello everyone. I am Neil Adams who graduate from Los Angeles Pacific University just before. I have some experience with React and other frontend javascript libraries, but not *Vue.js*.
So I just tried to write a very simple project on my own. Please, don't laugh at me and give me your hand.

## About project

* This project is a simple shopping project which follows *Gwendolyn Faraday*'s video tutorial. Actually, there were some problems in video such as version of the Vue Cli and other dependency problems. Anyway, I can complete this project as starting Vue.js.
